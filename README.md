# Dinosaur Island Character-Level Language Model
This repository showcases my implementation of an RNN-based character-level language model for predicting characters in the Dinosaur Island language.

### Assignment Highlights:
Text Data Storage: The repository includes the necessary text data for processing using an RNN, serving as the training dataset.

Character-Level Text Generation Model: I have built an RNN model that generates text at the character level. It has been trained on the provided dataset to learn patterns and dependencies.

Novel Sequence Sampling: The trained RNN model allows for the generation of novel sequences of characters, enabling the creation of new text passages in the Dinosaur Island language style.

Gradient Challenges and Solution: I discuss the challenges of vanishing and exploding gradients in RNNs during training. To address the issue of exploding gradients, I have applied gradient clipping, setting a threshold to limit gradient magnitudes.

By exploring the code and outputs, you can see the RNN model in action, generating text samples in the captivating style of the Dinosaur Island language.

Please refer to the relevant files in this repository to delve into the implementation details.

Note: The code and outputs provided are specific to the Dinosaur Island Character-Level Language Model assignment and may require adaptations for different languages or text generation tasks.
